<h1>Seed Planting Game</h1>
    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>This is a simple game made with <strong>Phaser 3</strong>. The player has to drag and drop seeds into the right spots on the screen to plant them. When the seed is placed correctly, it disappears, and a plant grows in its place. If the player tries to place something else in the wrong spot, a warning shows, and the item returns to its original position.</p>

    <h2>How to Set Up</h2>
    <h3>1. Clone the project</h3>
    <p>Run this command in your terminal:</p>
    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Yousefeslam214/phaser.git</code></pre>
    <h3>2. Go into the game folder</h3>
    <pre><code>cd phaser</code></pre>
    <h3>3. Install the necessary files</h3>
    <p>Run this to install everything the game needs:</p>
    <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
    <h3>4. Start the game using an HTTP server</h3>
    <p>Instead of using npm start, you need to run an HTTP server. Hereâ€™s how:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you donâ€™t have an HTTP server, install one using npm:</li>
        <pre><code>npm install -g http-server</code></pre>
        <li>Then, run the server in your game folder:</li>
        <pre><code>http-server</code></pre>
        <li>Open your browser and go to <strong>http://localhost:8080</strong> to play the game!</li>
    </ul>
